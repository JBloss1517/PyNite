# PyNite
A 3D frame, truss, and beam finite element library for Python.

# Dependencies
PyNite depends on the following packages:
* numpy: used for matrix algebra
* matplotlib: used for plotting member diagrams
* vtk: used for visualization - note that vtk requires a 64 bit installation of python. vtk does not need to be installed if you don't plan to used the visualization tools in PyNite.

# Contributors Welcome
If you would like to contribute to this project to expand, debug or improve it, I welcome your contributions. I'd like to get the library solving more than just frames. Feel free to issue pull requests.
